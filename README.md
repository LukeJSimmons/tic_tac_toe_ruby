# Tic Tac Toe in Ruby
Tic Tac Toe is a class game and beginner coding challenge. Sit down with a friend and play right from your terminal.

* Navigate to mastermind_ruby folder in terminal
* Run,
```
ruby main.rb
```
## Background
This project was built as part of The Odin Project Ruby course. My goal in making it is to expand my knowledge and hands-on experience with Ruby.
## Lessons Learned
I will be the first to admit that all my code being in the same class is not the best. I intend to take this lesson to new projects and build more Object Oriented Programs.
